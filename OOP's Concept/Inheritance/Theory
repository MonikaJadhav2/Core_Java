Inheritance is a feature in Java where one class acquires the properties and methods of another class.

It is used to achieve code reusability and polymorphism.

The class that is inherited from is called the superclass.

The class that inherits is called the subclass.

The keyword extends is used to implement inheritance.

Java supports single, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance.

Java does not support multiple inheritance using classes.

Multiple inheritance is supported through interfaces.

Inheritance creates an IS-A relationship between classes.

Method overriding is possible because of inheritance.

Inheritance reduces code duplication and improves maintainability.

Improper inheritance can lead to tight coupling.
