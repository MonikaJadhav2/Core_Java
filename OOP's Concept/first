OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects and classes.
Java is a pure object-oriented language (except primitive types) and implements all major OOP features.
Java is a platform independent language.

1. Class

Blueprint/template that contains variables (data) and methods (behavior).

2. Object

Instance of a class. Real-world entity created from a class.
We can create n number of object of a class.

🎯 4 Main Pillars of OOP
1️⃣ Encapsulation → Data Hiding

Wrap data + methods in a single unit (class).

Use private variables + getter/setter.
Benefit: Security and control.
....
2️⃣ Inheritance → Reusability

One class inherits another class using extends.

Types: Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical.
Benefit: Code reuse.

3️⃣ Polymorphism → Many Forms

✔ Method Overloading – compile time
✔ Method Overriding – runtime
Benefit: Flexibility and dynamic behavior.

4️⃣ Abstraction → Hiding Details

Show essential features, hide background code.

Achieved through abstract class and interface.
Benefit: Cleaner and simpler code.
