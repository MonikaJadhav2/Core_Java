1)What is static
static makes a member belong to the class instead of objects
Only one copy exists in memory
Shared by all objects of the class

2)static variable
Called class variable
Declared at class level
Created when class is loaded
Same value shared across all objects
Best used for constants and common data

3)static method
Belongs to class, not object
Called using class name
Can access only static members directly
main() is static so JVM can call it

4)static block
Executes once when class is loaded
Runs before main()
Used for one-time initialization

5)non-static block
Executes every time an object is created
Runs before constructor
Used for common object initialization

6)constructor and static
Constructor is always non-static
Static variables can be modified inside constructor using class name
Change affects all objects

7)this keyword and static
this refers to current object
Cannot be used with static members
Static members should be accessed using class name

8)static inner class
Belongs to outer class, not its object
Can be created without outer class object
Can have static and non-static members

 non-static is object-level
